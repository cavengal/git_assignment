# Git Assignment - cavengal

a. What is an issue?

An "issue" is feature used for tracking tasks, enhancements, bugs, or any other type of item that needs attention within a software project.
Github, since it's a web based platform for hosting Git repositories, provides an issue tracking system in which users can discuss problems, suggest new features, or ask questions related to a particular repository. They serve as a centralized hub for collaboration and communication within a project
Git, on the other hand, doesn't inherently have an issue tracking feature. Nevertheless an issue might be discussed in Git if managed through a centralized system like a project management tool or via the command line interface using certain conventions.

b. What is a pull request?

A pull request is a feature in version control systems like Git and platforms like GitHub, that allows developers to propose changes to a repository hosted on a platform like GitHub.
They are a key step in collaborative software development cycle. Once changes are created for a new feature or bug fix, to cite a few, developers push their branch changes to the remote repository and once there, they create a pull request to review and discuss changes with the project collaborators. 
Pull requests are usually created in response to an issue, especially if the issue describes a bug that needs fixing or a feature that needs implementing.
